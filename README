Laser Harp (Harp Space) for Spier Light Art 2019.

3 lasers shine from left and right hand side of art piece (6 lasers total)
They hit mirrors (some one-way, some two-way) to form a laser pattern, eventually terminating into 14 LDR sensors.
LDR resistance triggers a transistor when in complete darkness, input into Raspberry Pi GPIO. LDR does not trigger transistor when laser is shining on it.
When Raspberry Pi GPIO pin is triggered, the corresponding note is sent to Sonic Pi, which then plays it on a speaker.

3 ultra-sonic misters are placed above the piece, switching on and off via relay, so that the beams can be seen easily.
The piece is activated by a button so that the misters and lasers are not constantly on.
